# Techtile PLL board ‚úÖ

This PCB was developed by Guus Leenders from KU Leuven, in collaboration with DRAMCO, with assistance from Jarne Van Mulders. The board is utilized in a distributed antenna or **Radioweave** infrastructure and delivers a phase-synchronous RF output to the USRP by means of a PPS and 10MHz signal. 

‚ùó‚ùó This board is specifically designed for the **USRP B210** by Ettus. ‚ùó‚ùó

The PPS and 10MHz signals (coming from the octoclocks CDA2990) are amplified using on board buffers and are connected to the
* PLL IC (MAX287x) ‚ùó‚ùó **--> allowing for ‚àø phase synchronisation ‚àø**
* the flat cable connector (given that the raspberry pi also has access to these signals) ‚ùó
* the input SMA connectors of the USRPs intself ‚ùó‚ùó
  * ** 10 MHz --> ‚àø frequency synchronisation ‚àø for internal (RF) PLLs**
  * ** PPS --> ‚è∞ time synchronisation ‚è∞**

The board is controlled via I2C commands and features a flat cable input connected to the RPI HAT (developed by DRAMCO) to drive the PLL output. The most important registers are displayed below.

# Phase synchronisation in Techtile ToDo üìù
- Work further on python script to achieve phase-synchronised outputs with the B210 USRP. Validate and visualize the signals on the oscilloscope by using two separate setups consisting of RPI, USRP, PLL, PPS, and 10 MHz input.
